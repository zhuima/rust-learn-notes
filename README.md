# Rust Learn Notes

This repository, `rust-learn-notes`, is a collection of Rust projects and notes created during my journey of learning Rust programming language. It serves as a practical playground for experimenting with Rust concepts and building real-world applications.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into different projects, each residing in its own directory. As I progress in my Rust learning journey, more projects will be added to this repository.

Current projects include:

1. [TodoCLI](todocli/README.md) - A command-line todo list manager

## Projects

### 1. TodoCLI

A simple yet powerful command-line todo list manager written in Rust. It demonstrates basic file I/O, command-line argument parsing, and data serialization/deserialization.

For more details, see the [TodoCLI README](todocli/README.md).

## Future Projects

As I continue to learn and explore Rust, I plan to add more projects to this repository. These may include:

- Web applications using Rust frameworks
- System programming projects
- Concurrency and parallelism demonstrations
- And more!

## Getting Started

Each project is contained in its own directory. To get started with a specific project:

1. Navigate to the project's directory
2. Read the project's README.md file for specific instructions
3. Run `cargo build` to compile the project
4. Follow the usage instructions in the project's README

## Contributing
